# What You Forgot to Remember

What You Forgot to Remember is a minimalist, emotionally evocative web experience designed to feel like a dream you almost recall, but never fully do. It presents a random "memory" with surreal, nostalgic, or existential undertones and invites the user to pause, reflect, and maybe remember something they hadn‚Äôt before.
This is not a game. It is a feeling.

## Features

- Memory Reveal: One memory at a time, capped at 2 per day to preserve impact.

- Save as Image: Export revealed memories as aesthetic visual cards.

- Ambient Audio: Background ambient sound with toggle controls.

- Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes to match your mood.

- Memory Archive: View your previously revealed memories, stored locally.

## How It Works

When you press ‚ÄúReveal It‚Äù, the site selects a memory, some poetic, some unsettling, from a carefully curated list. You can save this memory as an image or view your archive of past recollections.

Only two memories may be revealed per day. This is intentional, designed to encourage reflection over consumption.
